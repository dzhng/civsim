# 11 — First-pair locomotion

Status: TODO. Acceptance depends on [10](./10-pair-surfaces.md). Candidate ready
and walk clips may be authored once the provisional rig and equipment contacts
are usable; final surface acceptance is not an authoring dependency. Freeze the
rig/kit revision for each motion comparison and repeat affected checks after refits.

## Contract and ownership

Idle/ready, walk/march and run communicate supported weight and equipment load.

API seam: Authored clips on shared human rig → clip registry and timeline; stride phase follows measured motion, visual root displacement removed to preserve sim positions.

Names of new functions/routes in this plan are proposed, not existing commands. Use the [shared acceptance contract](../README.md#acceptance-contract) and [architecture](../architecture.md) for inherited requirements.

## Runnable artifact

Individual looping clips and movement-speed ramp with heavy sword and phalanx carry/rest equipment.

Expose the fixture through the production model workbench and a named scene/probe. Record the exact runnable command in this file when it exists; do not mark completion with screenshots alone.

## Focused verdict

Variable: **Locomotion rhythm**.

Crop/mask: Feet/hips/shoulder frame strips plus whole-body loop; combat and material changes excluded.

Freeze all previously accepted variables. Capture the candidate and prior/reference with the same fixture manifest. Where a family has execution rows, record each row separately; do not change several rows before the first earns a verdict. Reuse is allowed only after that row's verification passes.

## Verification

Check planted foot intervals, no persistent sliding, plausible stride at actual game speed, planted idle, two-hand carry grip. Use deterministic snapCheck frame strips; derive GIFs from accepted frames.

1. Run the applicable deterministic contract tests and `snapCheck` captures; preserve unrelated tests and simulation outcomes.
2. Use **compare-screenshots** for candidate versus prior/reference on the named mask; retain telemetry and a written less-wrong verdict. A Rome II photograph is a visual target, not a pixel-equality baseline.
3. As the **last visual check before acceptance**, use **screenshot-critique** with an unprimed agent. Resolve verified defects in scope; record excluded defects against their owning slice. Do not describe a shot as verified before this check.
4. Archive feature evidence and comparison/critique notes under `assets/evidence/11/`; active regression baselines remain in their harness-owned location.

For a purely numerical probe, archive its output as well as the review surface; do not invent a visual-quality verdict from numerical success.

## Decision budget and feedback

Delegated: Stride amplitude/cadence and upper-body secondary motion within observed speed; no foot IK subsystem.

All other architectural, scope and quality changes are spec gaps: update/reslice the plan before widening the patch. Human feedback on the focused variable can reopen this slice; feedback on a frozen variable belongs to its owner.

When presenting shots, use **preview-shots**, offer approximately five minutes for feedback without a long blocking tool wait, then decide from evidence if the user is silent. Record the decision and rationale, close the opened Preview shots, and continue. Silence is not explicit endorsement, and failing technical/visual gates cannot be waived by silence.

## Completion record

- [ ] Contract and runnable artifact implemented.
- [ ] Execution rows, if any, each have evidence and verdict.
- [ ] Tests and inherited gates pass; changed-test behavior ledger recorded.
- [ ] Comparison and final unprimed critique recorded.
- [ ] Review/cleanup completed; README pickup and decisions updated.

Record actual commands, evidence links, measured results, decisions and unresolved defects here during implementation. No implementation or visual acceptance has occurred yet.

# Shared landscape quality

Status: implementation active; slices 01–03, 06 and 09 complete; production adapter adopted, acceptance still open. Updated: 2026-09-15.

Make the campaign landscape meet the supplied reference's quality and bring the same character to battle: connected ridges and valleys, ground that becomes mountain, vegetation that belongs to its slopes, and coherent water and lighting. Battle matches the location's character; it does not reconstruct campaign geography.

## Next Agent Prompt

Work in `/Users/david/dev/game-map-landscape-quality` on `codex/map-landscape-quality`. Campaign integration's ten reviewed images repeat exactly; battle forest density, categorical cover boundaries and signed shoreline are integrated. Journey settlement/disposal verification is integrated, but software handoff startup and rising JavaScript memory remain under diagnosis. The normalized handoff must pin both constructor seed and encounter tick before comparing backends; earlier pairs were invalid. A three-cycle weak-reference retention probe is prepared separately. Next mountain work is the elevation control in04: raw2km data improves branching but needs filtering for excessive fragmentation; no production asset adoption yet. Finish those bounded investigations, then remaining campaign journeys/canonical battle captures and whole-game hardware acceptance. Source-crest and signed-profile procedural replacements were rejected. Do not reapply the stale shadow stash/patch. Read owning evidence and update this handoff before ending a pass.

The user has authorized implementation, renderer migration, refactoring and as many reversible spikes as useful. Make these decisions without permission questions. No compatibility backend or save migration is requested. Preserve gameplay and existing save formats; this is a presentation change. Human review is a chance to steer, not a wait for approval.

Warnings: the regional spike remains below the whole-frame visual bar and is not production. The shared tiled slope profile deliberately changes steep-ground appearance; its old-profile control exactly reproduces the eight prior composition/anchor snapshots. Terrain-only hardware traversal passes the unchanged33ms gate; full UI/scenery performance remains open. Full SwiftShader turf readiness also times out on the matched parent; hardware and smaller canonical controls provide scoped evidence, not a replacement claim. Preserve unrelated work and do not reset the worktree.

## Review map

Open the self-contained [interactive roadmap](visualizations/roadmap.html) to inspect dependencies and compare the reference with the current spike. The ladder has three phases: prove the rendering foundation (01–03), establish landscape quality (04–10, with battle adoption at 13), and migrate campaign presentation and accept production (11–15). These are small verification passes, not fifteen new subsystems.

Tree representation (06) can follow 01 independently. Water boundaries (08) can follow 04 without waiting for vegetation. Battle adoption (13) can follow 10 independently of campaign overlays. Production adoption is now integrated; final acceptance still waits for both worlds.

## Fixed decisions

- One physical rendering foundation: campaign adopts the existing `PhotorealWorld` substrate. Share surface math, terrain/water response, model identities and environmental lighting. Keep strategic geography and battle physics in their existing owners.
- Mountains are connected terrain, not large rock props. Grass, scree and exposed rock follow the landform. Vegetation follows actual cover, slope and clearances.
- Match the reference's landscape qualities, not its exact coastline or pixel colors. Audit whole frames after judging individual variables. The existing aesthetic remains Bronze-Age Aegean.
- Retain current battle site recipes and authored templates. No new locale schema, map generator, erosion simulator, package dependency or renderer upgrade by default.
- Use bounded world-aligned terrain tiles and a coarse overview. Keep world seeds, shore distance and surface queries stable across windows. Exact bounds and physical/rendered query semantics are in [architecture](architecture.md).
- One camera/projection, environment, surface revision and renderer composition per world. No second GPU canvas, duplicate palette, lasting backend switch or campaign import from a battle-specific material implementation. Keep development routes thin; remove displaced owners when their last consumers migrate.

## Acceptance

Every visual slice explicitly uses [compare-screenshots](../../.agents/skills/compare-screenshots/SKILL.md) for candidate-versus-target judgment and an unprimed [screenshot-critique](../../.agents/skills/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md) as its last visual acceptance check. Green snapshots alone do not establish quality. Freeze the slice's other variables, use its named crops, and resolve in-scope findings. Publish shots during non-blocking review; keep working and decide from evidence without another permission request.

Production acceptance requires campaign interaction, overlay depth, labels, save/load and battle handoff to work on the new owner; battle movement, passability and generation must stay unchanged. It also requires full-frame quality review, deterministic repeat captures, stable residency and real hardware evidence. Selected performance targets and honest unavailable-hardware handling live in [architecture](architecture.md).

## Evidence and rationale

- [Architecture and ownership](architecture.md): contracts, units, water signals, budgets and retirement.
- [Validation](validation.md): reference crops, scenario matrix, commands and acceptance rules.
- [Research](research.md): primary sources and what their techniques actually justify.
- [Draft synthesis and fog audit](drafting.md): independent alternatives and decisions.
- [Reference image](assets/landscape-reference.png), [current Alpine spike](assets/spikes/current-alps.png), [current Italian spike](assets/spikes/current-italy.png).
- [Spike verification](verification.md): measured results and outstanding visual defects.
- [Merged presentation controls](assets/integration/geography-battle-standards/README.md): integration evidence for the current ownership, battle-material and standard checkpoints.
- [Superseded exploration](exploration.md): historical discoveries; this README owns the next action.

After all slices ship, use close-spec to archive the ladder as durable rationale. Do not mark the feature complete merely because the spec or regional spike is complete.
